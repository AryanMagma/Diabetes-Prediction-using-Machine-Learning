# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
#Overview
Predicting diabetes using machine learning is a significant healthcare challenge. This project utilizes a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various features, such as the number of pregnancies, BMI, insulin levels, and age. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the study aimed to create robust classification models for predicting diabetes and maximizing validation scores.
